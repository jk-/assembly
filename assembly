Chapter 1: Basic Concepts

MSB and LSB

Most significant bit
and Least significant bit

Most is on the left
Least is on the right

Integer Storage Types

byte        8-bits
word        16-bits
doubleword  32-bits
quadword    64-bits

A "word" is not "a word"

Unsigned Ranges:

byte        0-255
word        0-65535
doubleword  0-4294967295
quadword    0-18446744073709551615

Signed:
The MSB is the sign bit which tells us if the number is positive or negative.
0: positive
1: negative

Ranges:
byte        -128 to 127
word        -32768 to 32767
doubleword  -214744836448 to 2 billion
quadword    blah

Two's Complement Notation:
Trying to tell us that everything can be done by addition.

Steps:
Flip-bits (1's comp)
Add 1

1.4 Boolean Operations

NOT: ¬
AND: ∧
OR: ∨

"Order of operations":
NOT is first before parentheses
